# Excel-mini-project-employee-performance-dashboard
An Excel-based Employee Performance Dashboard was created to examine departmental KPIs and worker productivity.  To provide actionable insights for data-driven HR decisions, sophisticated formulae, pivot tables with interactive visualizations, and data cleaning were implemented.
ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to transform raw HR data into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel.
By leveraging Excelâ€™s core features and formulas, this dashboard highlights employee performance, departmental trends, and workforce distribution â€” all in an interactive, visually clear format.

ðŸ“ˆ Applied key Excel formulas (AVERAGEIF, COUNTIF, IF, VLOOKUP) to calculate performance metrics.

ðŸ“Š Built Pivot Tables to summarize performance by department and job role.

ðŸŽ¨ Designed an interactive dashboard using charts, slicers, and visual formatting for clarity.

ðŸ“‰ Dashboard Includes
